How This Program Works

- When the program  is run, a small window will open with a button titled "Translate a text file". Click this to open a window to select 
the input file.  
- The Python program will search for a file located in the directory titled "input.txt" . 
- This file contains the words that will be read by the program to be translated to Pig Latin. 
- The program will then ask for an output file. This is located in the directory as "output.txt"
- This file will be overwritten with the translated words when the Python program is finished.
